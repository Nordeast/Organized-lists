Deploying Organized list algorithms and studying their efficiency on different data sets.
Algorithms include:
MTF, COUNT, TRANSPOSE
Also added one by my design that is called Move half way to front(MTF/2).

Supprisingly MTF/2 does better on some data sets than all three of the more popular algorithms above.
